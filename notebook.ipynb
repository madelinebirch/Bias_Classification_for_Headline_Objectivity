    "In an era where information shapes perspectives, the media plays a pivotal role in influencing societal narratives. Understanding the subtle nuances and potential biases embedded in headlines is crucial, and this project aims to shed light on the degree of bias present in headlines. Focusing on data classification through machine learning, the project seeks to predict headlines into three classes: No Bias, Low Bias, and High Bias. The objective is not to scrutinize sensationalism or analyze sentiment polarity but rather to leverage textual and numerical features to predict the bias level accurately."

    "### Our Stakeholder: PBS News\n",
    "The significance of this project lies in its potential impact on journalism's objectivity, particularly for PBS News, a revered American news source known for its impartiality and lack of apparent agenda. Publicly funded by 15%, the entity continuously faces accusations of general bias and [threats of defunding from various actors](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/business/media/28cpb.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "By adopting insights gained from our efforts, PBS News can *silence these threats* and *secure its value* as a trusted source for objective, unbiased headlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Vision: Gender Bias in Headlines as a Framework\n",
    "We chose to focus on gender bias as a focus for this project because it is undeniably one of the most prevalent forms of bias in published news content. A 2021 Topic Modeling [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.664737/full) found women are unfortunately but not unexpectedly *mentioned* \"more frequently in topics related to lifestyle, healthcare, and crimes and sexual assault.\" Another 2021 Natural Language Processing [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245533) concluded, \"although\n",
    "we see a certain tokenism in having female *voices* present in the news, their voices are drowned\n",
    "out by the overwhelming number of times that we hear from men, often from just a handful of\n",
    "men.\" There's no denying that gender bias is present in news article content, both in references toward and quotations credited to women, but what about the content of *headlines?* Couldn't headlines about women be biased, too?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of this initiative is the recognition of headlines as powerful agents that shape our perceptions. These succinct phrases captivate our attention and mold our subconscious understanding of entire articles. The urgency to prove and maintain neutrality, especially on a platform as eminent as PBS, underscores the relevance of our undertaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our primary focus is on demonstrating which ML algorithms are most adept at detecting gender bias in headlines, this project could serve a framework for ongoing assessments of headlines across diverse bias types, including political, racial, LGBTQ+, socioeconomic class and beyond. The broader vision is to contribute to a media landscape characterized by transparency, objectivity, and accountability, fostering a public discourse grounded in fair and unbiased reporting."

    "# The Dataset<a id='The_Dataset'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset utilized in this project originates from a comprehensive collection of data scraped for [\"When Women Make Headlines,\"](https://pudding.cool/2022/02/women-in-headlines/) a visual essay published by [*The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/) in June 2022. Released by [Amber Thomas](https://data.world/amberthomas) on [data.world](https://data.world/the-pudding/women-in-headlines), this dataset is one of few open source datasets we could find that investigates gender bias specifically in headlines. It encompasses a diverse array of headlines about women, each annotated with corresponding bias scores. Bias scores were calculated following the methodology outlined in [\"Proposed Taxonomy for Gender Bias in Text; A Filtering Methodology for the Gender Generalization Subtype.\"](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3802.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset's origin in a visual essay adds an element of real-world applicability, grounding the project in the practical considerations of media consumption and perception. Its richness lies in its amalgamation of both textual numerical features associated with each headline. The text data provides the linguistic context of the headlines, while numerical features offer additional dimensions for analysis. This holistic approach enables the development of a machine learning model that can discern patterns beyond linguistic constructs, contributing to a nuanced understanding of what contributes to bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Working File\n",
    "The dataset contains a multitude of `.csv` files; for the sake of simplicity, we will be working exclusively with `headlines.csv` and engineering additional numerical features to bolster our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Target\n",
    "Our target variable will be `bias`."

    "- **Implication for our Stakeholder**: It is crucial to minimize false positives to maintain the credibility of PBS's ability to classify bias. Readers relying on these classifications should trust that the information accurately reflects the intended bias.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Cost**: A false negative occurs when a biased headline is *incorrectly classified as unbiased.* This might result in overlooking misleading information and passing off headlines that aren't fit to be published.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Role of Weighted F1 Score\n",
    "The Weighted Average F1 score is an appropriate evaluation metric for predicting headline bias categories for PBS due to its ability to balance precision and recall while accounting for class imbalance. In the context of classifying bias categories, it ensures that the model's performance is assessed considering *both false positives and false negatives,* providing a comprehensive measure of predictive accuracy."

This tool uses optimized neural networks identifying bias categories in headlines throughout the editorial process.\n",

    "- **Guided Editing Notes:** For content flagged with bias, the tool's various pre-loaded functions provide users with actionable and specific editing suggestions. For instance: \"Consider neutralizing language in this sentence.\" OR \"Use active voice for greater clarity and objectivity.\" OR \"Adjust the tone to ensure a balanced representation.\"\n",
    "- **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless integration into the editorial workflow.\n",
