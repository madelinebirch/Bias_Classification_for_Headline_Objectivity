# Project Overview
In an era where information shapes perspectives, the media plays a pivotal role in influencing societal narratives. Understanding the subtle nuances and potential biases embedded in headlines is crucial, and this project aims to shed light on the degree of bias present in headlines. Focusing on data classification through machine learning, the project seeks to predict headlines into three classes: No Bias, Low Bias, and High Bias. The objective is not to scrutinize sensationalism or analyze sentiment polarity but rather to leverage textual and numerical features to predict the bias level accurately.

### Our Stakeholder: PBS News
The significance of this project lies in its potential impact on journalism's objectivity, particularly for PBS News, a revered American news source known for its impartiality and lack of apparent agenda. Publicly funded by 15%, the entity continuously faces accusations of general bias and [threats of defunding from various actors](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/business/media/28cpb.html). 

By adopting insights gained from our efforts, PBS News can *silence these threats* and *secure its value* as a trusted source for objective, unbiased headlines.

### Our Vision: Gender Bias in Headlines as a Framework
We chose to focus on gender bias as a focus for this project because it is undeniably one of the most prevalent forms of bias in published news content. See: [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.664737/full)& [study].(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245533) 

At the heart of this initiative is the recognition of headlines as powerful agents that shape our perceptions. While our primary focus is gender bias in headlines, this project could serve a framework for ongoing assessments of headlines across diverse bias types, including political, racial, LGBTQ+, socioeconomic class and beyond.
